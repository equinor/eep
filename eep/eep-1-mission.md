## Abstract

Equinor Enhacement Proposals is a safe place to present ideas to others, 
gather feedback and hopefully build "teams" of people interested in one
 of the ideas presented without the top down approach.

## Motivation (why)

As you all know, we (Equinor IT employees) can have 20% of the time 
dedicated to learn pretty much anything we want, given that we think 
it will help the company. 

So far I have done it, but I feel something is missing that does not allow me 
to progress as much as I want:
some of my side projects and ideas need more heads (different angles,
 validation, and much more) and, sometimes, more hands (faster building).

In addition, I can't find a place where these "smalish" cool ideas can be 
found and discussed between peers, and I am pretty sure that there are plenty.


## Objective (what)

Equinor Enhacement Proposals (EEP) could be a meeting place for these 
kind of ideas, a way to record them and organize a healthy debate 
in a constructive community.

If the idea/debate attracts enough people, the project can
 move forward and build something better than what one person can do.

Even if the EEP doesn't take off, the person presenting the idea is 
in a better position: he/she has been able to put it all in writing 
and has got some good feedback about it.
