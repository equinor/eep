# Equinor Enhacement Proposals

Welcome! unlike most of the repos in Github, you won't find much code here 
but hopefully a lot of vivrant ideas and a community that will support you with constructive
feedback and even "hands on" help. 

## Why...

#### should I share my idea?

- I will need to "land" my idea into writing, this process allows you to think more clearly about it.  
- I can't find people to bounce the idea and validate assumptions.
- It is too big for me, I will never ever finish it, I need X, Y, Z...
- May be I lack expertise in an area and I need guidance.
- The more the merrier :)


#### should I help in developing other's ideas?

- I can learn other fields by doing.
- I can guide others in getting to know fields I love.
- I can get out my comfort zone, into the wilderness.
- It just feels good :)


### How do I show my idea?

Firstly, gather some strength, exposing and idea to the public could be risky for your pride, 
luckily, EEPs is a safe place, a community driven by constructive feedback, so open your mind.
Think this way, presenting the idea you will be a better position than keeping it for yourself,  
you have been able to put it all in writing and you will have feedback about it.

You have to fork the repository and create a new document with the format explained in 
[eep-0](https://github.com/equinor/eep/blob/master/eep/eep-0-formats-and-templates.md) under the /eep folder.
Just have a look at this one: [eep-1](https://github.com/equinor/eep/pull/3)

Then create a pull request, this is going to be the discussion arena for your idea, make sure you
copy the title of the idea and, as comments, the header and the abstract so it is searchable. 
You will be notified every
time someone comments on it by mail, the discussion can be as long as needed.

Eventually your idea will mature and you will know that is time to go for it. 
Then you have the freedom to pursue it as you like, during the interactions you could find
enthusiastic people that could help you with it. Then just mark the idea as Active development (tag), and 
hopefully point the repo or website where it is being developed.

Then it is time to merge the PR with master and be a part of the EEP official list.

If you don't want to go forward with it, then just mark it as Abandoned, I would recommend to leave the PR in the
repository, someone else could be interested later on and rescue it. 

### How do I look for ideas?

Ideas are present in the list of [Pull requests](https://github.com/equinor/eep/pulls). 
The title should be quite descriptive so you can try to find something appealing to you.

You can find the status of the relevant Ideas (PRs from now on) in the labels: Request for comments, Active when it is 
in development already, and Abandoned if the idea creator has left it.  

In addition, all the documents have a header with technologies related to the project if applicable. So you could
issue a search like this: 
```bash
 in:body python 
```

### How can I help?

Helping others effectively to develop their ideas is great, but it can be tricky since most of the times
you don't know the intention of the person publishing the always brilliant idea in the creator's mind.
So, be open minded, you could be helping someone trying to enter a new field, 
or an expert that needs a very specific feedback or collaboration. 

This could be a handy check list before jumping on the keyboard:

- Put yourself into the creator's shoes, exercise empathy, one of the best capacities of human beings.
- Clear your vision of the idea, if it is not clear enough, ask for more info.
- Figure out what kind of help he/she needs and if you are able to give it, if not you might know someone who can, 
so spread the word.
- Create a constructive conversation, express your opinions as such (we all have them, they are all respectful), add factual 
information when relevant.
- You don't need to win, no one does, if it looks like a contest, reroute it, you could be missing the point.
- Enjoy it, it is a wonderful experience.
