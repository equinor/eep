# Equinor enhacement proposals

## Motivation (why)

As you all know, we (Equinor IT employees) can have 20% of the time dedicated to learn pretty much anything we want. 

So far I have done it, I am a person interested in many things, like many of us, but I feel something is missing that does not allow me to progress as much as I want:
some of my side projects and wild ideas need more heads (different angles, validation, and much more) and hands (faster building) than my own.

In addition, I can't find a place where these "smalish" cool ideas can be found and discussed, and I am pretty sure that there are plenty of them.


## Objective (what)

Equinor Enhacement Proposals (EEP) could be a meeting place for those who have these kind of ideas, a way to express them and organize 
a healthy debate. 

Finally, if the idea/debate attracts enough people the project can move forward and build something better than what one person can do.

Even if the EEP doesn't take off, the person purposing it is in a better possition: he/she has been able to put it all in writting and has got some good feedback about it.


## Possible roads (how)

This is absolutely open, my first thought was something similar to [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) but with some key differences:
- There is no "whise" validation on the project/idea. The idea is validated by people gathering around it and devoting its training time.
- Ideas are expressed in PRs to this repo, with some structure. In the PR is where all the constructive discussion should happen. The slack channel could be good for other kind of open communication like coordination, etc.


## Spread the word, speak up, give feedback.
